### Scope
The energy impact of IT infrastructures is a significant resource issue for many organisations. The Natural Resources Defence Council estimates that US data centers alone consumed 91 billion kilowatt-hours of electrical energy in 2013 – enough to power the households of New York twice-over – and this is estimated to grow to 139 billion kilowatt-hours by 2020. However, this is an underestimation as this figure fails to take into account other countries and all other computer usage. There are calls for reducing computer energy consumption to bring it in line with the amount of work being performed – so-called energy proportional computing. In order to achieve this we need to understand both where the energy is being consumed within a system and how modifications to such systems will affect the functionality (such as QoS) and the energy consumption. Monitoring and changing a live system is often not a practical solution. There are cost implications in doing so, and it normally requires significant time in order to fully ascertain the long-term trends. There is also the risk that any changes could lead to detrimental impacts, either in terms of the functionality of the system or in the energy consumed. This can lead to a situation where it is considered too risky to perform anything other than the most minor tweaks to a system. The use of modelling and simulation provides an alternative approach to evaluating where energy is being consumed, and assessing the impact of changes to the system. It also offers the potential for much faster turn-around and feedback, along with the ability to evaluate the impact of many different options simultaneously.
 
ENERGY-SIM 2017 seeks original work that is focused on addressing new research and development challenges, developing new techniques, and providing case studies, related to energy-aware simulation and modelling.

## Abstract
Recent advances in networks and computing systems have led many aspects of our daily life to depend on distributed interconnected computing resources. Large scale distributed systems such as computational and data grids and clouds are used for serving large and complex applications. Grids and clouds performance became more important due to the increase of users and computationally intensive applications. However, the usage of energy has become a major source of concern for these systems due to the price of electricity and the impact on the environment. 

Energy efficiency in large scale distributed systems reduces energy consumption and operational costs. However, energy conservation should be considered together with users’ satisfaction regarding QoS. Complex multiple-task applications may have precedence constraints and specific deadlines and may impose several restrictions and QoS requirements, therefore energy-efficient job scheduling is a difficult task in grids and clouds where there are many alternative heterogeneous computers. Advanced modelling and simulation techniques are a basic aspect of performance evaluation that is needed before the costly prototyping actions required for large scale distributed systems. 

In this talk we will present state-of-the-art research covering a variety of concepts on resource allocation and job scheduling in large scale existing or simulated distributed systems that provide insight into energy conservation problems solving. We will also provide future directions in the area of energy efficiency in grids and clouds.
