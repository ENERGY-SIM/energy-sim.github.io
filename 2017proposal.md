### Scope
The energy impact of IT infrastructures is a significant resource issue for many organisations. The Natural Resources Defence Council estimates that US data centers alone consumed 91 billion kilowatt-hours of electrical energy in 2013 – enough to power the households of New York twice-over – and this is estimated to grow to 139 billion kilowatt-hours by 2020. However, this is an underestimation as this figure fails to take into account other countries and all other computer usage. There are calls for reducing computer energy consumption to bring it in line with the amount of work being performed – so-called energy proportional computing. In order to achieve this we need to understand both where the energy is being consumed within a system and how modifications to such systems will affect the functionality (such as QoS) and the energy consumption. Monitoring and changing a live system is often not a practical solution. There are cost implications in doing so, and it normally requires significant time in order to fully ascertain the long-term trends. There is also the risk that any changes could lead to detrimental impacts, either in terms of the functionality of the system or in the energy consumed. This can lead to a situation where it is considered too risky to perform anything other than the most minor tweaks to a system. The use of modelling and simulation provides an alternative approach to evaluating where energy is being consumed, and assessing the impact of changes to the system. It also offers the potential for much faster turn-around and feedback, along with the ability to evaluate the impact of many different options simultaneously.
 
ENERGY-SIM 2017 seeks original work that is focused on addressing new research and development challenges, developing new techniques, and providing case studies, related to energy-aware simulation and modelling.
 
Specific topics of interest to ENERGY-SIM 2017 include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Simulation/Modelling for energy reduction
    - Estimation of energy consumption
    - Evaluation of techniques to reduce consumption
- Simulation/Modelling for smart-grids
    - Simulation/Modelling of micro- and macro-level energy generation and supply
    - Simulation/Modelling of smart-grid deployments
- Simulation/Modelling of energy in computer systems
    - Data centre simulation/modelling
    - Individual component simulation/modelling
    - Multi-scale system simulation/modelling
- Simulation/Modelling for energy in the Internet of Things
    - Simulation/Modelling of Internet of Things systems including battery operated systems
    - Simulation/Modelling of energy scavenging approaches
- Performance and validation of energy-aware simulations and modelling
    - Benchmarking and analytical results
    - Empirical studies
- Theoretical foundations of energy-aware simulation/modelling
    - Theoretical models for energy-aware simulation/modelling
- Energy-aware simulation/modelling packages and tools
    - Energy-aware simulation/modelling packages under development from the community

### Submission Guidance
Papers will be accepted in one of two formats:

- Short work in progress/position papers, up to 4 pages in length

- Full papers, up to 6 pages in length

Papers describing significant research contributions of theoretical and/or practical nature are being solicited for submission. Authors are invited to submit original, high-quality papers presenting new research related to energy-aware simulations.

The papers that are accepted and presented at the workshop will be published by ACM and disseminated through the ACM Digital Library. It is intended that the best papers will be put forward for a Journal special edition post workshop.

Submission will be made via EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=TBD" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=TBD</a>
